**Status:** Currently existing in a superposition of employed and unemployed until the next standup meeting collapses the wave function.
# Experience & skills 

**Director of dynamic interpolation for comprehensive media distribution and analysis** as it applies to heuristic community building and efficient workplace design practices through the open ambiguity foundation. Former head of technical minutiae at the global foundation of situational systematic dependence and programmatic regression analysis. Lead team lead at corpcorp.

**Chief Architect of Recursive Nonsense** at the Institute for Deliberate Confusion (2019-2023). Specialized in exponential bewilderment scaling and the implementation of circular logic loops in enterprise-grade befuddlement systems. Successfully deployed 47 instances of organized chaos across 12 continental drift patterns.

**Senior Consultant for Existential Debugging** at the Department of Theoretical Practicality. Resolved critical issues in the space-time continuum of code repositories. Invented the revolutionary "SchrÃ¶dinger's Commit" methodology - code that simultaneously works and doesn't work until observed by a production server.

**Principal Engineer of Atmospheric Programming** specializing in cloud-to-brain interfaces and the development of sentient documentation that writes itself while you sleep. Led a team of 3.7 developers (the .7 was an intern who existed only on Tuesdays).


# Currently Learning

* Industrial confusion & inconvenience engineering
* Force push and pray (advanced techniques including "git blame the intern")
* Verbose abstraction (in the general sense as it applies to cubic regression)
* Analytical analysis of analytical analytics
* Rats (those lil cheese eating gray guys)
* Quantum entanglement of legacy codebases
* Emotional support for deprecated functions
* The ancient art of commenting code in interpretive dance
* Blockchain-based sandwich making
* Machine learning for machines that are already learning to learn
* Telepathic debugging (remote empathy protocols)
* The socioeconomic implications of rubber duck programming
* Hydroponics for growing organic algorithms
* Interdimensional git merging
* Professional aura point farming through clean commit messages
* Advanced skibidi algorithms for maximum rizz optimization
* No cap debugging (lies detection in production environments)
* Sigma grindset deployment patterns
* Bussin API design that absolutely slaps
* Mid-tier rejection protocols (filtering out cheugy code)
* Gyatt-level error handling (when exceptions hit different)
* Slay-driven development methodologies
* Vibe-based version control systems
* Quantum computing for quantum coders
* Intergalactic API standards (for when your code needs to reach the stars)
* Astrological debugging (aligning your code with the stars for optimal performance)
* Astro-compatibility testing (ensuring your code vibes with the universe)

# Core Competencies

* Fluent in 17 programming languages, Namely (Javascript Typescript Rust Go lang Zig Python HTML CSS PHP )
* Certified in Advanced Procrastination Optimization
* Expert-level confusion generation with 99.7% uptime
* Professional overthinker with a minor in catastrophic assumptions
* Specialized in building robust systems that fail gracefully while screaming internally


# Philosophy

Vibe coding is obsolete, real ones **aura code**. We don't just have aura, we ARE the aura. The future belongs to those who can channel the ethereal essence of computational spirits through ritualistic keyboard summoning while maintaining maximum rizz-to-bug ratio.

We don't just ship code - we literally slay with every commit. Our functions are bussin, our algorithms absolutely slap, and our documentation? No cap, it's giving main character energy. When production breaks, we don't panic - we simply emit chef's kiss error messages that are low-key poetry.

*"Why fix bugs when you can befriend them and teach them to vibe?"* - Ancient DevOps Proverb (Verified on Stack Overflow, trust me bro)

**Current mood:** Touching grass between sprints while my code deploys itself because it knows I'm built different.
